We continue to refine this experience. The primary focus now is to design a system for analyzing the performance of these engines. Students will design a data acquisition system that plots the thermodynamic cycle and evaluates the performance. The students will also assist in project implementation.","FALSE","https://youtu.be/rJtEdPveiNI, https://youtu.be/0SB9kuVyElE","https://drive.google.com/open?id=15VgsLp23OHKERbYJy6exPjAoSB1Ifr1n","","reilly95, walker149","General: I would like to specify a general number of students required.","3","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering design (Iterative process to develop systems or solutions that meet defined requirements and constraints, incorporating applicable engineering standards, as outlined by ABET.)","Students will design a data acquisition system for project engines.

# Models are Stored here.

# Useful Information Below
#######################################
# Anything that ends in Field() is an input method. Users can supply information which will be used when creating an item from a given model
# Methods ending in handler are not their own unique models, rather they are owned and used by other models. Look at ClinicNumberHandler for example. This has its own fields, but is only accessed through a Clinic instance. This was done to ensure dynamic allocation of majors for futureproofing.
# Within all field() methods, you can pass various settings. These include things like whether it can be empty, blank, or maximum input length. Additionally, on_delete=models.CASCADE is used on all modelFields (foreignKeysFields) to ensure the reference will be deleted to prevent issues if a referenced object is deleted.
# related_name is used to define internal names for ManyToManyFields. This is done in case of things like the Professor Model, where you have multiple M2M Fields pointing to the same Model. Django uses these names internally to differentiate between the two.
# Fill in more as need #
